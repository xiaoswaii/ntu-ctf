There are some comment code state that they need tea. And the tinyurl is 418isFake, 418 is a famous teapot protocol. Then i just `curl -X BREW http://chal.tuctf.com:32000/teapot`. This will know that there is a `broken.zip` file in the server, just donwload it and unzip. It have a file.txt in the folder.That is the flag.
